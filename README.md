This application is a investment analysis and research tool, as well as a portfolio modeler.  It provides price historical price data
and news on for publicly traded stocks.  Users can research and lookup companies by stock ticker symbols.  Users can also "purchase" and "sell" a hypothetical
portfolio to model investment strategies and stock picks over time.

When a user elects to "purchase" a stock, the price, number of shares, and date of purchase are stored to local storage.  At future dates when the user
loads the application previous purchases are displayed and performance is tabulated.  This enables users to model a portfolio over time with real stock data.
